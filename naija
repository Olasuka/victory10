Arise, O compatriots, Nigeria's call obey
To serve our fatherland
With love and strength and faith
The labor of our heroes past
Shall never be in vain
To serve with heart and might
One nation bound in freedom, peace, and unity.

Oh God of creation, direct our noble cause
Guide our leaders right
Help our youth and truth to know
In love and honesty to grow
And living just and true
Great lofty heights attain
To build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.

The current national anthem was adopted in 1978 to replace the previous national anthem, "Nigeria, We Hail Thee". The wordings are combination from words and phrases taken from five of the best entries in a national contest - P.O. Aderibigbe, John A. Ilechukwu, Dr. Sota Omoigui, Eme tim Akpan and B.A. Ogunnaike. The words were put to music by the Nigerian Police Band under the directorship of Benedict E. Odiase
